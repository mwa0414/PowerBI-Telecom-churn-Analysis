# PowerBI-Telecom-churn-Analysis
# Background

Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned, and like the Retention Manager from our telecom Client, no brand wants to lose them. A few weeks after presenting the Telecom Customer Churn Analysis - Power-BI dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reached out directly to Shantanu. He was impressed by the work and asked for a dashboard about customer retention.

Additionally, the telecom Retention Manager scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to better understand the data. Some points covered in the meeting include:

Proactive Customer Retention: In the telecom industry, retaining customers is paramount. The retention department's primary objective is to re-engage customers in the event of contract termination. Presently, their approach is reactionary, reaching out post-termination. However, a proactive strategy to identify at-risk customers beforehand would be more effective.

Past Analysis Limitations: Previous attempts at customer analysis using Excel have proven fruitless, resulting in dead-ends. This underscores the necessity for a more sophisticated and efficient analytical approach.

Enhanced Customer Insight: There's a pressing need for comprehensive customer analysis within the telecom sector. Visual representations of this data, designed to be self-explanatory, are essential for effective communication with the management team. The retention manager has provided some resources to facilitate this process, highlighting its importance.
